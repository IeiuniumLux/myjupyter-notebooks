# myjupyter-notebooks

## Quick Start

If you want to play with these notebooks without having to install anything, then open this repository in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/IeiuniumLux/myjupyter-notebooks.git/master):

**NOTE**: Binder creates a new environment from scratch every time this repo is updated or when you launch it for the first time; and in those cases it takes quite some time to start the service.  Be also aware that Binder provides a temporary environment, therefore, anything you do will be deleted after a while.
